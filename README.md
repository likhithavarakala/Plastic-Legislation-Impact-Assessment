# Assessing the Effectiveness of US Plastic Legislations through 5 Gyres' Audits

## Overview
This project evaluates the efficacy of US plastic legislation using data from 5 Gyresâ€™ audits, legislative records, and census data. We explore how laws influence plastic waste levels across various states.

## Key Findings
- States with plastic bans show significantly lower per capita waste, suggesting bans are effective in reducing pollution.
- States with plastic taxes often have higher waste levels, indicating that taxes alone may not be sufficient.
- The annual variability in waste underscores the influence of enforcement and public compliance.

## Conclusions and Recommendations
The study suggests that plastic bans are more effective than taxes in curbing pollution. We recommend wider implementation of bans and further investigation into the effectiveness of taxes.

## Data Sources
- **5 Gyres**: Details on plastic waste from cleanups.
